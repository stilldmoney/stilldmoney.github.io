## Is this real life?
I began the 2020 year with so much optimism! I left my last job and decided to maximize my time by remodeling my home. This project took a few months but everything came out great and it's led to a better living space for my family and I, so I decided to get back on the job market in February.

I had no idea that this COVID-19 pandemic was lurking around the corner and it hit the world by storm!! The effects of this pandemic have changed daily living to the core. Schools shutdown. Social gatherings cancelled. Everything halted all at once. Social isolation and self-quarantines became the new norms in a global effort to slow down contagion.

## My purpose for this blog
The imposition of these safety measures have resulted in a dwindling job market for me. As a result, I've decided to dedicate the little free time I could muster between parenting and keeping my household afloat during this extended quarantine to learning penetration testing.

I've spent the majority of my twelve year career in IT dedicated to blue teaming as an information security professional managing corporate infrastructure (e.g. Active Directory, network firewalls, routers, switches, servers, storage, <_insert any other technology here_> )... the gist of it is that I find it fascinating how one miscofiguration or one misguided assumption could lead to full system pw0nage. As a dedicated blue teamer its incredibly frustrating to know that so much work can be squandered by hacker(s) who decide to put your organization in their crosshairs. 

But as someone who likes tinkering with tech... it peaks my interests and so I decided to harness the "hacker mindset".

## My Goal
My goal is to document as much as I can regarding my journey to OSCP. I know there's tons of content out there just like this, but I really just want to put my experience in one place in case it may help someone in a similar situation.

## My Next Steps
I come at the doorstep of this next challenge with extensive experience in various areas- network/system/server admin, Linux/Mac/Windows systems management, sprinkle in some containerization and DevOps experience, and some scripting in Python, Bash, PowerShell, along with some SOC experience, and many years of automating my day-to-day tasks as much as possible... all this to say, I feel I have a good foundation in preparation for this certification. I'm sure I will struggle just like everyone else has in starting this journey, but I will follow the "try harder" mindset.

For now, I've enrolled in a few platforms to get familiar with CTF-type challenges. I am working on HackTheBox, PentesterLab, and Pentester Academy's AttackDefense labs to get some hands-on. Eventhough, I start this training during a difficult time, I take solace in knowing that difficult times are always transitory... what follows these challenges lead to ultimate enlightenment.

Stay safe everyone!
